# HSL/HSV Color Models

## Introduction

HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) and HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value) are two color models that represent colors in a way that is more intuitive to human perception. These models are used in various applications, including image editing and design software.

## Properties of HSL and HSV

- **Hue:** Represents the type of color (0-360 degrees on a color wheel).
- **Saturation:** Represents the intensity or purity of the color (0-100%).
- **Lightness/Value:** Represents the brightness of the color (0-100%).

## How HSL and HSV Work

### HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)

- **Hue:** Defines the color type.
- **Saturation:** Defines the intensity of the color (0% is gray, 100% is full color).
- **Lightness:** Defines the brightness (0% is black, 100% is white).

### HSV (Hue, Saturation, Value)

- **Hue:** Defines the color type.
- **Saturation:** Defines the intensity of the color (0% is gray, 100% is full color).
- **Value:** Defines the brightness (0% is black, 100% is the color at full brightness).

## Applications

### Image Editing

- **Adjustments:** HSL and HSV are used in image editing software to adjust colors in a more human-friendly way.
- **Color Selection:** These models are useful for selecting and modifying colors in design projects.

### Web Design

- **CSS Colors:** HSL is supported in CSS, allowing web designers to specify colors in a more intuitive manner.

## Conclusion

HSL and HSV color models provide a more intuitive way to represent and manipulate colors, making them essential tools in image editing and design. Understanding these models helps in achieving more precise and user-friendly color adjustments.
