## Introduction

White is a color that is perceived when an object reflects all the wavelengths of visible light equally. In digital applications, white is the combination of the highest values of red, green, and blue light. White plays a crucial role in various technical applications, including digital imaging, user interface design, and data visualization.

## Properties of White

- **RGB Representation:** White is represented by the highest values in all three channels (R: 255, G: 255, B: 255).
- **Hexadecimal Code:** #FFFFFF
- **CMYK Equivalent:** C: 0%, M: 0%, Y: 0%, K: 0%
